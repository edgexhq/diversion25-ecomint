      What is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is like digital money, but instead of being controlled by a bank, it runs on a special technology called blockchain, which is like a big online notebook that everyone can see but no one can change unfairly. Imagine you and your friends are playing a game where you keep track of points in a shared notebook—everyone can check it, but no one can cheat. That's how cryptocurrency works! Bitcoin is the most popular one, like a rare digital coin, while Ethereum is like a smart digital ticket that can do more than just store value. People use crypto to buy things online, send money to others (like PayPal but faster), or invest, hoping its value will go up—kind of like buying gold or rare sneakers. However, its price can change a lot, so it's exciting but risky! NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, which is like a special digital collectible. Imagine you have a rare Pokémon card—there may be similar ones, but yours is unique and has its own value. NFTs work the same way but in the digital world. They can be digital art, music, videos, game items, or even tweets. Each NFT is stored on a blockchain, proving that you own the original version, just like a certificate of authenticity for a rare item. While you can screenshot an NFT image, only one person can officially own it on the blockchain. Some people buy NFTs as investments, like collecting rare sneakers, but their value can change a lot. A crypto wallet is like a digital version of a real wallet, but instead of holding cash, it stores your cryptocurrencies. It doesn't actually store the coins themselves but keeps the secret keys (like passwords) that let you access and use your crypto. There are two main types: hot wallets (online and easy to use, like a mobile app) and cold wallets (offline and safer, like a USB device). Imagine a hot wallet like a digital payment app (such as Google Pay), while a cold wallet is like keeping money in a safe at home. Some of the wallets include Metamask, Phantom, Trust. If you lose your wallet's secret key, you lose access to your crypto forever, so keeping it safe is very important! in our platform :
